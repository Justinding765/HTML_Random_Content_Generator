# HTML_Random_Content_Generator
- This script is for replacing the content of HTML files with random content. 
- This script will NOT modify the structure of the file, or any web functionalities. 
Thus any CSS or Javascript related content will not be modified

- Having HTML tags as part of the content that is randomized may cause bugs.
